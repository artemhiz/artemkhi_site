                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>I'm Artem, 19 y.o. and I'm a web-developer.</p>
                    <p>I like working with code for long, especially somewhere at the nearest Starbucks. I have been living for the most of my life in my hometown - Rostov-on-Don, Russia, but now I live in Istanbul, Türkiye. I studied to be a programmer at RKSI (CICR) and now taking courses on new web-development tools.</p>

                <p>I was always fascinated by techs, and actually I always wanted to make it my work. I always knew what's the difference between different devices, understood technology much and still like sharing my knowledge about it with everyone. I studied greatly at 9 grades, and afterwards I went to the best college of my hometown to be a technic programmer. And I was introduced to HTML there, and in that moment I've realized that I want to study it deeper, because I understood that I like the front-end more, because I like working on things the user sees, working every detail out.</p>

                <p>But life make its own adjustments, and I'm moving with parents, firstly to Moscow, and then to Istanbul where I live until today. Here I like spending my time walking around the city, riding metro and listening to music. And if I find a coffee shop nearby, I'd like to stop and work. But such decisions become into me realizing that I'm sitting at a café for hours forgetting about anything else. This is what I think "to be lit by your work" means.</p>
